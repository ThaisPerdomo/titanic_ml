# Titanic Challenge Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the Titanic Challenge Machine Learning project! This repository contains code and resources for predicting survival rates on the Titanic using basic machine learning techniques.

## Description

This project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, class, and others. The dataset includes information about passengers, such as their name, age, sex, class, fare, and survival status. The data is sourced from the Kaggle competition: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).


## Contents

- `data`: Contains the dataset files (`train.csv`, `test.csv` and `gender_submission.csv`).
- `notebooks`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation. The notebooks also offer step-by-step explanations of all the procedures carried out.
- `output`: Contains the output files generated during the project.
  - `images`: Contains images and plots generated during data analysis and model evaluation.
  - `csv`: Contains CSV files generated during data preprocessing or as model outputs.

## Basic Concepts of Machine Learning

Before diving into this project, it's helpful to understand some basic concepts of machine learning that will be used here:

- **Supervised Learning**: In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data, and the goal is to predict an output based on input data.
- **Training and Testing Data**: The dataset is divided into two subsets: the training set, used to train the model, and the testing set, used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
- **Features (X)**: These are the input variables used to make predictions. In this project, features could include passenger attributes such as age, sex, class, etc.
- **Target (Y)**: This is the variable we are trying to predict. In this project, the target variable is whether a passenger survived or not.
